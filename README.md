list-based selection, and advanced pattern matching. Features dry-run previews,
CSV export reports, and flexible component deletion strategies.

**Key Features:**
- **Multiple Selection Methods**: Direct IDs, shot name patterns, list selection, or advanced search
- **Wildcard Support**: Use `*` for pattern matching in shot names (e.g., `SHOT_*` matches all shots starting with "SHOT_")

- **Dry Run Mode**: Preview deletions before execution with detailed impact analysis
- **CSV Reports**: Export deletion reports to Downloads directory for record keeping

```

**2. Shot Name Patterns (with wildcards)**
```
Enter shot name pattern: SHOT_*     # Matches all shots starting with "SHOT_"
Enter shot name pattern: *_010      # Matches all shots ending with "_010"

```

**3. List-based Selection**

- Select specific items from the list

**4. Advanced Selection**

**Safety Features:**
- Dry-run mode shows preview before deletion
- CSV reports exported to Downloads folder
- Confirmation prompts for destructive operations

## Running from Binaries

#### Windows

Simply download the relevant file under
[Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/AstraFtrackTools/releases/latest) and
open it.

#### Linux

1. Download the relevant file under
   [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/AstraFtrackTools/releases/latest).
2. In the terminal app of your choice, make the file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x AstraFtrackTools-linux
   ```
3. Run the executable.

#### macOS

Due to aggresive security restrictions on macOS, and me not wanting to pay for a
developer license, I can't easily sign the binary to avoid a warning message. So
you'll need to:

1. Download the relevant file under
   [Releases](https://github.com/your-repo/AstraFtrackTools/releases/latest).
2. Open Terminal
3. Navigate to the downloads folder:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```

4. Remove quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine astraftracktools-macos
```

5. Make executable:

```bash
chmod +x astraftracktools-macos
```

6. Run:

```bash
./astraftracktools-macos
```

## First Setup

On first run, the app will ask you for your Ftrack credentials and automatically
test them:

- **Ftrack Server URL** (e.g. https://yourcompany.ftrackapp.com)
- **Ftrack API User** (e.g. your ftrack associated email)
- **Ftrack API Key** (secure password input)

### Getting Your API Key:

1. Log into your Ftrack instance
2. Go to **My Account** (top right)
3. Navigate to **Security Settings**
4. Under **Personal API Key**, click **Generate New Key**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è This key will only appear once and can be revoked/regenerated anytime

The tool will automatically test your credentials and securely store them
locally. You can update credentials anytime using the "Set Ftrack Credentials"
option in the main menu.
